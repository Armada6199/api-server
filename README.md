### notes i took from walid today 

> sequelize makes it easier for us to handle queries made to the sql database  using it buillt in methods for making the schemas and models ,and also for inserting ,posting ,deleting ,and updating 
> its better to make an index for the models which will handle all the initialization of the models and exporting them ,so you dont repeat your self and also maintain a clear code
